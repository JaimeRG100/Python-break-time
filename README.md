People works really long hours on a computer. If you could only remember to walk away from the computer for a little bit.

This Python program, schedules breaks throughout the day, reminding you to take a break in something like play his favourite song on Youtube.

The break has set to 10 seconds, for you can try it without have to wait to much time to see it in action.
You can change the number of breaks changing total_breaks variable.
You also can change the timer, changing the parameter of time.sleep(), providing a time in seconds.
